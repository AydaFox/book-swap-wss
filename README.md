# Cluster Books WebSocket Server

## About

This is the repo as part of a group project to create a book swapping app. This server is designed to allow for instant messages between users, so they can communicate and organise swapping books they have advertised.

This server is only designed to work in tandem with a MongoDB that is limited to greenlisted users (our team) so will not currently run locally for other users.
